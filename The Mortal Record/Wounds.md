## Memories
- Witness violence for the first time as a toddler.

- Transplanted from my home country into America. Bullied for not understanding English.

- Family thrust into poverty. 

- Public humiliation during school lunch. 

- Homelessness.

- Parents' suicide attempts.

- Low-grade pervasive stress from a traumatic home environment pushes me into a nearly decade long depression.

- Panic attacks as I write all 22 of my college applications hours before they are due.

- Accepted to 2/22 colleges I applied to. Dreams of an easy high-life escape from poverty, crushed.

- Instead of chasing my dreams of becoming a filmmaker, I "sell out" as a computer engineering student.

- 8 months of ~25 hrs/wk committed to an a capella group. COVID shuts down international flights a week before the London Tour.

- Learn that not everyone has your best interests in mind. The hard way.

- Realize I will never fully be like the international Korean students. Always knew I would never be an "American". Didn't know Korean-American $/ne$ Korean. 

- Fail a second-year course in Analog Signal Processing because I hate the pretentiousness of Electrical Engineering professors.

- Fail the same course again, this time in the midst of a relationship that drained all of my time, energy, and money. First Academic Probation.

- Pass the failed course, but get two Ds in different courses. One expected understanding of multiplication after lecturing about addition. The other was just my bad lol. Second Academic Probation.

- B+ in the infamously hardest course in the department, A- in the second hardest and lowest passing average course in the department, but D- in a 93.1% A class-average General-Education requirement fulfilling course. Department Advisor tells me that I'm too stupid for the major at first, looks at my transcript and is left scratching his head. Third Academic Probation.

- I fail my friend as his class partner as he spends all day tending to his dying mother. I can't get myself out of bed at this point.

- I walk and receive my dipoloma frame (they mail the real one). Two weeks later, I receive an email while on a family trip to the Rockies from my department letting me know I did not fulfill my graduation requirements because I failed the course.

- It takes two years for me to leave my hometown/collegetown. Nearly kill myself.
